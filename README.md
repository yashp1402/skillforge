# Authentication Overview

Auth.js (NextAuth) with Credentials provider:

- `/auth/sign-up` → Register  
- `/auth/sign-in` → Login  
- `/api/auth/*` → Backend routes  
- Sessions stored in Prisma `Session` table  

Protected routes handled via:

```ts
export { auth as middleware } from "./lib/auth";
```

---

# Database Schema Highlights

Prisma models used:
- User  
- Skill  
- JobTarget  
- JobRequiredSkill  
- LearningGoal  
- JobApplication  
- Session (Auth.js)  

`Account` and `VerificationToken` models removed as they are not required for Credentials auth.
